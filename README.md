# Csharp
Tier 1: Beginner (Syntax Literacy)

This is language fluency, not understanding.

You can write C# without knowing why it works.

Subjects

Variables & primitive types

if / else, switch

for, foreach, while

Methods & parameters

Classes & objects

Basic constructors

Properties (get / set)

List<T>, Dictionary<TKey,TValue>

Simple exception handling (try/catch)

Console I/O

🧠 This is knowing how to speak sentences.

Tier 2: Intermediate (Object-Oriented Thinking)

👉 Most bootcamp grads and junior devs live here

Now you understand structure, not just syntax.

Subjects

Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

Interfaces vs abstract classes

Reference vs value types (basic)

null handling

Basic generics

Enums & structs

Dependency injection (usage, not design)

Basic async/await

Simple LINQ (Where, Select)

Unit testing basics

🧠 This is understanding how objects relate and why.

Tier 3: Advanced (Professional Engineer Level)

Most senior developers top out here.

You can build production systems safely.

Subjects

Deep async/await semantics

Task vs ValueTask

Threading basics & synchronization

Garbage collection fundamentals

Performance-aware coding

Advanced LINQ

Delegates, events, lambdas

Generic constraints

Exception design

IDisposable & resource management

SOLID principles in practice

API design & versioning

🧠 This is writing C# that is correct, maintainable, and performant.

⚠️ Most people think this is the top.
It is not.

Tier 4: Expert (Runtime & Systems Engineer)

Now C# becomes a tool, not the focus.

You understand what the runtime is doing.

Subjects

CLR execution model

IL (Intermediate Language)

JIT compilation

Method inlining & devirtualization

Memory layout & object headers

Stack vs heap mechanics

Garbage collector internals

Allocation strategies

Span<T>, Memory<T>, ref structs

Unsafe code & pointers

Native interop (P/Invoke)

ThreadPool internals

Lock-free programming

Profiling & benchmarking

🧠 This is knowing what the runtime is doing behind the scenes.

Tier 5: Research / PhD-Level (Language & Runtime Science)

🔥 This is where “PhD level in C#” actually lives.

C# becomes secondary.
You are studying language design, compilers, and execution theory.

Core Subjects (ALL of these matter)
📐 Language Theory

Type systems & variance theory

Type inference algorithms

Value vs reference semantics (formal)

Immutability guarantees

Memory safety proofs

Compile-time vs runtime tradeoffs

Formal language specs (ECMA C# spec)

⚙️ Compilers & Runtime Systems

Roslyn compiler architecture

ASTs & semantic models

JIT optimization research

Tiered compilation strategies

GC algorithm design

Allocation & escape analysis

Runtime metadata tables

Ahead-of-Time compilation (NativeAOT)

WASM execution models

🧵 Concurrency & Correctness

Memory models & reordering

Happens-before relationships

Lock-free & wait-free algorithms

Transactional memory concepts

Formal concurrency proofs

Async state machine generation

📊 Performance & Hardware Interaction

CPU cache behavior

Branch prediction

SIMD & vectorization

False sharing

NUMA considerations

Hardware intrinsics

Performance modeling

🧪 Research & Innovation

Designing new C# language features

Runtime optimization proposals

Static analysis tooling

New GC strategies

Benchmarking methodologies

Language evolution tradeoffs

Cross-runtime experimentation
