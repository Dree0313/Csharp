# Tier 1: Beginner — C# Syntax Literacy

## Purpose
This section focuses on **C# language fluency**.  
The goal is to become comfortable reading and writing basic C# code with correct syntax and predictable behavior

At this stage, the emphasis is on:
- Knowing what common C# constructs look like
- Understanding how basic programs are structured
- Building confidence writing and running C# code

---

## Concepts Covered

### Core Language Building Blocks
- [Variables](01_Core_Language/01_Variables.cs)
- [Primitive types (`int`, `double`, `bool`, `char`, `string`)](01_Core_Language/02_Primitive_types_(int,_double,_bool,_char,_string).cs)
- [Type assignment and initialization](01_Core_Language/03_Type_assignment_and_initialization.cs)

### Control Flow
- [`if / else`](02_Control_Flow/01_if_else.cs)
- [`switch`](02_Control_Flow/02_switch.cs)
- [`for`](02_Control_Flow/03_for.cs)
- `foreach`
- `while`

### Methods & Program Structure
- Defining methods
- Method parameters
- Return types
- Calling methods

### Object Basics
- Classes
- Creating objects with `new`
- Basic constructors

### Properties & Encapsulation
- Auto-properties (`get / set`)
- Public vs private access (into level)

### Core Collections
- `List<T>`
- `Dictionary<TKey, TValue`
- Adding, removing, and accessing elements

### Error Handling
- `try / catch`
- Basic exception flow
- Understanding runtime errors vs complie-time errors

### Input & Output
- Console output (`Console.WriteLine`)
- Console input (`Console.ReadLine`)
- Basic string interpolation

## Expected Outcome
After completing this tier, I should be able to:
- Read basic C# programs and understand what they do
- Write simple C# programs using common language constructs
- Control program flow using conditionals and loops
- Create simple classes and objects
- Store and retrieve data using basic collections
- Handle simple runtime errors
- Confidently run C# programs from the console
